# 4U Final Summative Project

This was my final project for ICS-4U. 
The purpose of the program is to simulate text-based data of bank accounts and transactions.
I demonstrate reading/writing/editing txt files, pointers, polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, operator overloading, and working with multiple files.
